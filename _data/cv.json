    "summary": "Over the past 15+ years I’ve delivered business‑critical products across multiple domains—gaming, e‑learning, social networking, marketing automation and CRM—while living and working in the Philippines, Singapore, China and Sweden. That international exposure has honed my ability to navigate diverse markets, cultures and regulatory environments, align global stakeholders and lead distributed agile teams. I combine empathy and clear communication to build trust, uncover true user needs and guide cross‑functional teams. I thrive on translating complex requirements into scalable, high‑impact solutions—whether launching a language‑learning platform to millions or rolling out CRM integrations for enterprise customers.",
